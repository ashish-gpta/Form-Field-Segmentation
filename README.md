# Form Field Segmentation

In this assignment we work on processing photos and scans of printed form (of immunization records) in order to extract the form fields and the written information entered in them.

Since many of the images have been taken by lay participants in uncontrolled environments, they have varying orientation, illumination, contrast, etc. which makes them harder to process automatically. We aim to extract the form fields from each image, and detect the written information in each field.
